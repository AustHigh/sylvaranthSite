        I like the detailed home page that mentions what will be on the website and where it is. It’s very important that all the books we use are shown, in case others want to follow suit. Books getting bigger when hovered over is a nice touch. Images and text have nice axes. 
Places on the world map are a little small. Clicking the star to see a description about the place is really cool, but would like more places with stars like that.
The descriptions on the hero page are very funny and match the characters perfectly. Messaging a hero is a really cool idea, and the form looks very clean. However, there is a lot of empty space below the form, which isn’t necessarily bad but could be used for an image or something.
The campaign page is really unique, pretending to be a book flipping pages, perfect for DND. The background can make it a little hard to read though.
What really sells DND is the characters, and the whole website, especially the lore page, do just that. Finding out tidbits about the characters make them come alive, just like in DND
Overall, I really enjoy the website for bringing our campaign to life, and with style too.
