                    &emsp;&emsp;Welcome, to the world of Sylvaranth! This is a site dedicated to a Dungeons & Dragons campaign taking place in the fictional realm of Sylvaranth. Within this
                    site you will find information about the world of Sylvaranth, the heroes, the campaign itself, and random tidbits of lore. On this page, the official Dungeons & Dragons
                    books and manuals used by this campaign are shown. If you click on the image, it will bring you to a place to purchase them, if you wish to become a Dungeon Master yourself! Along with the contents given to the Dungeon Master by these books, a little bit of homebrew magic is sprinkled in as well.
                    On the "WORLD" tab, a map of Sylvaranth is shown, with some key locations marked on the map, along with some information about each location. If you venture over to the "HEROES"
                    page, you will find yourself face-to-face with the heroes of this campaign. The "CAMPAIGN" tab holds journal-esque entries describing the events of
                    each campaign session. And finally, the "LORE" tab is simply a collection of random lore about the world of Sylvaranth ('Fun facts', if you will!). I hope you enjoy
                    venturing into the mystical, but sometimes horrifying, world of Sylvaranth!
