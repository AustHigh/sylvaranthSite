                    KHODEL:
                    A port city ruled by King Khodel III. A budding, cultural city. Filled with artists, writers, and musicians who
                    come from all around to make a living doing what they enjoy. <br> Full of many works from local artists, the Khodel Institute
                    of Art is well known for its spectacular pieces. <br> This city is also home to The Docks, full of sailors and merchants. This is always a lively side of town
                    and the source of the city's main imports and exports across the sea. <br> This city is where our heroes saved King Kohdel from a Doppleganger attack, and earned
                    his respect, earning a place among his royal guard.
